TetrAI

A python script for playing Tetris with AI

Actually it's just set up to incorporate AI.

It has a DeepQ Learning neural network in it
but I don't know how to incorporate it.

But you can play it for yourself.
Use Arrow Keys or A,S,D,W
Use Space for the different AI states.

Don't be fooled by the PLAY state:
It just selects random states right now!

And the TRAIN state does not train,
but collect samples and initiate train
when desired. 
It does NOT train nothing right now.

<You can use PLAY to make it harder.>

Have Fun!
